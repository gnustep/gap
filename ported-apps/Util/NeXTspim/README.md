# NeXTspim

NeXTspim is a NeXT-style AppKit front end for SPIM, James Larus's MIPS
R2000/R3000 simulator.  It runs MIPS assembly programs, displays registers,
text and data segments, provides a console, and includes debugger-oriented
controls such as stepping, breakpoints, and register editing.

## History

SPIM was originally written by James Larus as a self-contained simulator for
the MIPS R2000/R3000 architecture.  It can read and run assembly language
programs and implements most of the assembler-extended MIPS instruction set.
The code in this repository is based on SPIM 5.0-era sources and includes the
optional cycle-level SPIM support by Anne Rogers and Scott Rosenberg.

Mark Gritter ported the XSPIM interface to NeXTstep in the early 1990s.  The
original `Documentation/NeXTspim-1.0.README` describes NeXTspim as a NeXTstep
2.1 application with almost all of the functionality of `cl-spim` and
`cl-xspim`, packaged with user documentation and programmer notes.

This repository is a modern source port of that NeXTstep application.  The UI
has been moved to Cocoa/GNUstep AppKit APIs, and the original Interface Builder
`.nib` has been replaced with programmatic window and menu construction so the
application can be built directly from source.

## Current Application

The current build produces `NeXTspim.app` on macOS and a GNUstep-style
application wrapper on systems with GNUstep installed.  The main window is
assembled in code and contains:

- a toolbar for loading programs, running, stepping, clearing state, and opening
  breakpoints;
- editable main and general-purpose register fields;
- a text segment view with the current program counter highlighted;
- a data/stack/kernel-data view;
- a console view backed by a keyboard input queue.

Preferences control simulator options such as bare-machine mode, loading the
default trap handler, hexadecimal register display, memory-mapped I/O, and the
UI update interval.  Cycle-level cache, TLB, and pipeline controls are still
guarded by `CL_SPIM` conditionals.

## Repository Structure

- `NeXTspim_main.m` starts `NSApplication`, installs the AppKit delegate,
  locates bundled resources such as `trap.handler`, initializes SPIM, and
  enters the application run loop.
- `SPIMInterface.[hm]` builds the main menu and main window programmatically,
  connects AppKit actions to simulator commands, and renders registers, text,
  data, cache, and pipeline state.
- `RunLoop.[hm]` provides the pthread-backed simulator execution loop and the
  mutex/condition wrappers used to coordinate the UI thread with the simulation
  thread.
- `TextView.[hm]`, `CodeView.[hm]`, `ConsoleView.[hm]`, and `ConsoleText.[hm]`
  implement the AppKit text surfaces used by the code, data, and console panes.
- `KeyQueue.[hm]` buffers console keyboard input for simulated programs.
- `PrefsPanel.[hm]`, `BreakpointsPanel.[hm]`, `ContinuePanel.[hm]`, and
  `StatsWindow.[hm]` implement the auxiliary panels and statistics windows.
- `data.*`, `inst.*`, `mem.*`, `run.*`, `sym-tbl.*`, `spim-utils.*`,
  `mips-syscall.*`, `read-aout.*`, `scanner.*`, `parser.*`, `lex.yy.c`, and
  `y.tab.*` are the SPIM assembler, loader, memory, instruction, syscall,
  parser, and execution engine sources.
- `cl-cache.*`, `cl-cycle.*`, `cl-except.*`, and `cl-tlb.*` are the optional
  cycle-level SPIM support sources.
- `trap.handler` is the default SPIM trap handler bundled with the app.
- `Info.plist`, `Info-gnustep.plist`, `NeXTspim.desktop`, `spim.tiff`,
  `NeXTspim.icns`, and `NeXTspim.iconset/` are application metadata and visual
  resources.
- `Documentation/` contains the original NeXTspim README, user documentation,
  programmer notes, and the SPIM/cycle-level PostScript manuals.
- `Makefile` builds the executable and application wrapper for either macOS or
  GNUstep.  `Makefile.preamble` is a legacy build fragment that records the
  historical `-DBIGENDIAN -DCL_SPIM` configuration.

Generated files such as object files, `NeXTspim`, and `NeXTspim.app` are ignored
by git.

## Building

On macOS with the command line tools installed:

```sh
make
make run
```

On GNUstep systems, install the GNUstep base, GUI, and make packages first.
The same `make` target uses `gnustep-config` when it is available.

The build copies `trap.handler`, the TIFF icon, and selected documentation into
the application wrapper so the simulator can find its runtime resources from
inside the bundle.

## Documentation

The historical documentation is still useful for understanding both the user
interface and the porting decisions:

- `Documentation/NeXTspim-1.0.README` gives the original release overview.
- `Documentation/NeXTspim.doc.rtf` is the original user documentation.
- `Documentation/NeXTspim.rtf` contains programmer notes, known issues, and
  NeXT-specific implementation details.
- `Documentation/spim.ps` and `Documentation/cycle.ps` are the SPIM and
  cycle-level SPIM manuals.
